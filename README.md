# align.css

[Documentation](http://yamartino.github.io/align.css/)

Trying to find a nice way of having css helpers for centering and aligning on the web. Centering has always been hard, it has gotten a lot easier with things like flexbox, but how can we make it dead simple with helper classes?

I would love this repo to be more of a conversation about the best way to do this stuff. I don't think I know the best way and am open to pull requests and suggestions on this.
